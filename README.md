 and this page contain : menu on the top, Login and Registeration links<br>
 on the right side of the corner.<br>

 Let's take a look to the Login page:<br>
 Here is the login page actually for the Managers (not for the users), because the users can order without signing up!
 They can only fill the Customer Information and send it (I will show it below later)<br>
 As you can see below, we must to write true (username and password).
