 Take a look to the main <About> page of this coffee shop:<br>
 From here users can read about the sho,
 and this page contain : menu on the top, Login and Registeration links<br>
 on the right side of the corner.<br>

 Let's take a look to the Login page:<br>
 Here is the login page actually for the Managers (not for the users), because the users can order without signing up!
 They can only fill the Customer Information and send it (I will show it below later)<br>
 As you can see below, we must to write true (username and password).

 ##From the Product list page users can buy and order their coffee.

User can buy different types of product by clicking "continue buy"<br>
 1.buy the product<br>
 2.set the quantity<br>
 3.update quantity<br>
 4.continue buy or enter customer info.<br>
 All the choosen products will be in "My cart" section.

In order to finish our order we need to fill the customer information and submit it.

 Another thing is Login as Manager<br>
 login: manager1<br>
 password: 123<br>
 Manager has some additional functions as "Registering new Employee", "Crating a new Product", "Order list"
 <br>
 ![manager login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73636880/171747018-42941e6d-b0fe-41c3-8f11-a6344e6c5dce.png)
 ![registration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73636880/171747646-e9b099aa-a1ea-4478-803b-a1594a52352e.png)
 
 Loggin in as employee will be restricted from functions as creating new products and registering new employee.
